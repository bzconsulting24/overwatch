Here's why it's necessary and how it helps
Enhanced State Estimation
Better Object Recognition
Improved Decision Making
Fault Tolerance
turning raw uncertain sensor data into a coherent model of the world
extracting relevant features, localizing and mapping, recognizing objects and context, and fusing sensor data
distinct strengths and weaknesses depending on the situation
affected by lighting conditions, performance degrades in low light, glare, or shadows
occlusion and motion blur can struggle with displaced or overlapping objects
not sensitive to lighting and high spatial resolution
performance affected by weather, rainfall, or fog that attenuate laser signals
no single sensor is perfect; combining them allows a robot to compensate for individual weaknesses
enhances overall perception accuracy and reliability
commonly used as a foundational algorithm for sensor fusion
combining information from multiple noisy sensors to produce a more accurate estimate
prediction step and update step
motion model projects uncertainty ahead
incorporates measurements, for example from sensors like lasers or cameras
weighted based on how reliable each sensor is, more uncertainty equals less weight
adaptive filters or multiple-model approaches
adjusting how much it trusts each input using the Kalman gain

to determine the approximate sample size for estimating the mean height
introduce bias into the study and reduce the generalizability of the results
represent the overall population's height distribution accurately
this bias can't be corrected just by increasing the sample size
maintain accuracy and keep the margin of error within acceptable limits
prioritize efficient sampling methods like stratified sampling
avoiding overestimation that would unnecessarily inflate sample size
the calculated confidence interval accurately reflects the uncertainty
the mean is sensitive to outliers
providing a more stable measure of central tendency
structured approach in my perspective
statistically significant evidence
a significantly lower defect rate
brings the data closer to normality
retain all the data while making the distribution more normal like
