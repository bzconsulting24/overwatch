[00:00:00.000 - 00:00:12.919] The school gives us so much. My best friends go here, mentors who I've looked up to my entire
[00:00:12.919 - 00:00:18.080] life, teach and coach here and it's really shaped who I am as a person.
[00:00:18.080 - 00:00:24.519] Having men of character is so essential in our society today and St. Mark's is building
[00:00:24.519 - 00:00:30.399] this community of outstanding young men to go out in the world and to do great things.
[00:00:30.399 - 00:00:36.879] The mission is to turn boys into young men who can be leaders. In that regard it's the
[00:00:36.879 - 00:00:43.519] same as it was 60 years ago when I graduated. I think that long term commitment to our
[00:00:43.519 - 00:00:48.359] school really resonates with the boys. It makes them feel like they are a part of something
[00:00:48.359 - 00:00:54.280] really special and for generations to come this will be their school.
[00:00:54.280 - 00:00:58.320] I don't think there's many places like this where you constantly ever have alumni involvement
[00:00:58.320 - 00:01:02.880] or parent involvement. It really makes our campus what it is today.
[00:01:02.880 - 00:01:08.640] People get involved here as a family. They come to games, they come to events. I think
[00:01:08.640 - 00:01:13.760] it becomes truly a part of their lives. When we say we stand on the shoulders of giants
[00:01:13.760 - 00:01:17.599] it's not only a reminder that we are the product of those that come before us but it's
[00:01:17.599 - 00:01:21.040] also a reminder that we need to be leaving a legacy for those who are going to come after
[00:01:21.040 - 00:01:30.040] us. Giving really promotes community. One of the most special things about St. Mark's
[00:01:30.040 - 00:01:35.920] that I will always have for the rest of my life is this family. It's a community and
[00:01:35.920 - 00:01:41.520] you invest in your community, you take care of your community, however you're able to.
[00:01:41.520 - 00:01:48.840] I love seeing so many alumni involved and I think it shows a level of interest that's
[00:01:48.840 - 00:01:57.040] real. It's not just a dollar amount but it's also a community feeling. This is not just
[00:01:57.040 - 00:02:02.200] a few people driving this. Folks who came before me provided a great
[00:02:02.200 - 00:02:07.960] environment for me to grow and flourish as a boy on the way to becoming a man and I'm
[00:02:07.960 - 00:02:13.920] forever grateful for that. Well, I can never repay that but I can provide a way to open
[00:02:13.919 - 00:02:20.159] the doors for boys who are intellectually curious, exhibit a strong character and have
[00:02:20.159 - 00:02:26.959] a real strong desire to contribute meaningfully to St. Mark's. We want to provide opportunities
[00:02:26.959 - 00:02:30.599] for the next generation of Mark's minutes that reciprocal care. It's something that's
[00:02:30.599 - 00:02:37.079] stressed to us from when you step on campus all the way to when you graduate. We truly
[00:02:37.079 - 00:02:42.039] believe that St. Mark's cares as much about our son as we do and wants the best for him
[00:02:42.039 - 00:02:46.400] and I know that's true for every student that comes through the door. It's the person
[00:02:46.400 - 00:02:52.280] that they become on that journey that St. Mark's values the most, not just their list of
[00:02:52.280 - 00:02:59.519] accolades. St. Mark's isn't just a school, it's really a family and you always take care
[00:02:59.519 - 00:03:05.519] of your family. This place, it's a home away from home for me and so I think it's really
[00:03:05.520 - 00:03:07.760] important to provide that for the future generations.
